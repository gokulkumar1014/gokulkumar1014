### 🧭 Who I Am
I’m an engineer-turned-analyst passionate about turning **data and algorithms into strategic intelligence**.  
From building AI-driven agents to modeling optimization systems, I bring together **technical depth** and **business reasoning** to create data products that *speak the language of decision-makers*.

🔹 Currently: Designing a **Business Intelligence AI Agent** that connects structured (DuckDB) and unstructured (ChromaDB) data using **LangChain + LangGraph**.  
🔹 Previously: Modeled supply chain optimization with Gurobi, predicted bike-share demand, and delivered analytics consulting for D.C. organizations.  
🔹 Always: Curious about **agentic AI**, **LLMs**, **MLOps**, and the frontier of **decision intelligence**.
